Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------
I decided to use twitter bootstrap fame work for the CSS.
Althought I am not happy with the layout of the page it serves its purpose.
I initally had a cover background-imgage of Air Jordan that I was very proud of,
but after numerous issues I had with it zooming in everytime I submitted my form,
I decieded to ditch it.

I stuck with a basic red and white color scheme to commemorate the legendary Air Jordan.
